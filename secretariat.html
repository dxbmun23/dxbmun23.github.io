                        <p>Hello everyone! I'm Arshita and I will be serving as your secretary-general for the duration of this conference. Looking back to my childhood, I used to be that one kid who never talked in class or raised my hand even though I knew the answer very well. I always had a lot to say but didn't have the courage to say it. My journey to where I am today began with my teacher forcing me to join my school's MUN club. What was initially a means to impress my teacher, soon became an integral part of my life. As much as I enjoy social nights and making new friends, what I really love about MUNs is the sense of accomplishment I feel when I can think on my feet and make my own decisions. With that, I hope all of you get to have an unforgettable experience at our conference. Can't wait to see you there!</p>

                        <p>There is more to see than can ever be seen and more to do than can ever be done. What's important is to make every moment of whatever you do unforgettable. I'm Dhruv Toprani and I'll be your Secretary General for DXBMUN'23. I've been doing Model UNs for about 5 years. Although every time I look back, seldom do I remember the witty comebacks, the perfectly formatted resolutions, or the glory of all the awards I picked up along the way. What I remember the most is all the remarkable people I've crossed paths with and the memories I've made. No matter where you are on your journey, an unforgettable adventure awaits you!</p>

                        <p>Hi, I'm Baden and I'll be serving as the Deputy Secretary General for the duration of the conference. I like politics and debates and naturally MUN has become a favorite hobby of mine. In specific world history has always fascinated me; even though to most it may seem old and boring, to me it's symbolic of how humans have been able to overcome any problem, persevere, and develop. The real strength behind the success of our civilization has not only been our (on average) larger minds but our ability to communicate and cooperate. To me, the very spirit of MUN is not only the awards or the speaking but rather the friends we make along the way. Truly MUN teaches us that friendship really is magic.</p>

                        <p>What if I told you that the world was to end some 30 years ago? That the Cuban Missile crisis hadn't ended the way it actually did; that somehow diplomacy failed and a nuclear war started? It sounds like an apocalyptic universe straight out of a novel, only, it would be true if diplomacy hadn't displayed it's power and let peace triumph. My warmest greetings to each of you! I am Krithi Reddy .K, the Director General of DXBMUN'23. With the aim of celebrating diplomacy and all its successes, DXBMUN'23 is all set to welcome you to one of the best conferences to have existed. And with that it gives me great pleasure to invite all those budding changemakers, diplomats and future presidents for 3 days of extensive learning, debating and most importantly, changemaking.</p>

                        <p>Hi everyone!! I’m Naira Faizal and I’m absolutely delighted to be the Head of Volunteers for this year’s conference of DXBMUN. When I started off as a delegate, MUN never really appealed to me; but as I attended more conferences I realized I had this new found love for politics and speaking. I owe my entire confidence and knowledge to this passion of mine, it really shaped who i am today, and I’m utterly grateful. A very mistaken opinion about MUNs are that it’s always about debating. Correctly speaking, it’s about working towards a solution that’ll benefit the international community by training future world leaders. By the end of the conference, hopefully all of you will gain new memories and friends and I’m truly excited to see everyone there!</p>

I am someone who greatly enjoys the platform a MUN conference provides to discuss world issues that may not be acceptable in other social settings, and the opportunity it provides to create wide networks and make connections with people outside of my comfort zone. After attending over 15 conferences, I have come to realize that MUNs are not just about debating and arguing on an agenda, but instead, it's more about arriving at solutions for global issues. I am sincerely looking forward to reading feasible resolutions and experiencing controversial debates. I hope that all of you will take home valuable lessons, good memories, and new friends.</p>

                        <p>Hello! My name is Amritha Anil and I’m honored to be the USG of Logistics for DXBMUN’23. I realized very early on, that to most people your opinions were worthless, but even if they weren't willing to listen, if I spoke firmly and convincingly enough perhaps they would consider at least some of what I said. Thus I took it upon myself to be a convincing speaker and a good debater. MUN just so happened to be the perfect outlet for me to hone my skills and I have never regretted a moment of my time in the MUN circuit. Everyone’s story is different and I don’t know if this the moment where you step onto a new station or if this is just another stop along your journey but I hope you can leave feeling fulfilled. Thank you and I hope to see you soon!</p>

                        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Annika Das, and I have the honour to serve as the USG PR for DXBMUN 2023. I always figured, due to the pandemic, a lot of the things that made MUN fun would change. Thankfully, my favourite part of MUN, the passive aggressive politics of voting for sponsors on a resolution written by 10+ people, has stayed the same. Seriously though, I will forever remain an active advocate for MUN and hopefully help make this year's conference an unforgettable experience for both beginners and the experienced alike. Hope to see you all there!</p>
