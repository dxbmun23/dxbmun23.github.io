                        <p>Hi, I am Eshal and I will be serving as the Secretary General for this edition of DXBMUN. I am someone who greatly enjoys the platform a MUN conference provides to discuss world issues that may not be acceptable in other social settings, and the opportunity it provides to create wide networks and make connections with people outside of my comfort zone. After attending over 15 conferences, I have come to realize that MUNs are not just about debating and arguing on an agenda, but instead, it's more about arriving at solutions for global issues. I am sincerely looking forward to reading feasible resolutions and experiencing controversial debates. I hope that all of you will take home valuable lessons, good memories, and new friends.</p>

MUN holds a very special place in my heart and it's the primary reason for my confidence. From being a shy delegate , to gavel chasing , then a part of the sec team and finally now the Secretary General,  I've done it all and looking back on these experiences I don't remember the awards and certificates but I do remember the friends I made along the way and the gyatt I discovered . I can assure you that this year's DXBMUN will be unforgettable and inspire all of you to attend more muns , Hope to see you all on the 8th of December!</p>

                        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Annika Das, and I have the honour to serve as the Deputy Secretary General for DXBMUN 2023. I always figured, due to the pandemic, a lot of the things that made MUN fun would change. Thankfully, my favourite part of MUN, the passive aggressive politics of voting for sponsors on a resolution written by 10+ people, has stayed the same. Seriously though, I will forever remain an active advocate for MUN and hopefully help make this year's conference an unforgettable experience for both beginners and the experienced alike. Hope to see you all there!</p>

                        <p>Buongiorno, my name is Saurav Talukdar, and I am delighted and honoured to serve as the Director General of DXBMUN'23. After participating in Model UNs for almost three years, I've realised that what I truly enjoy are the conversations and the memories I've built along the way—not the accolades, the flawless resolutions, or the countless ROPS. Having participated at over 20 events, my MUN journey has been the most remarkable. With that, I sincerely hope that everyone will have an incredible time at DXBMUN'23. I hope to see everyone there!</p>

                        <p>Hi everyone!! I’m Naira Faizal and I’m absolutely delighted to be the Internal Advisor for this year’s DXBMUN. When I started off as a delegate, MUN never really appealed to me; but as I attended more conferences I realized I had this new found love for politics and speaking. I owe my entire confidence and knowledge to this passion of mine, it really shaped who i am today, and I’m utterly grateful. A very mistaken opinion about MUNs are that it’s always about debating. Correctly speaking, it’s about working towards a solution that’ll benefit the international community by training future world leaders. By the end of the conference, hopefully all of you will gain new memories and friends and I’m truly excited to see everyone there!</p>

                        <p>We are the generation that has learned to make excellent moves with the limited choices that we have. We have all learned to knock on closed doors a few times and when they do not open, to move forward with the hopes of better potential accepting that there is no way to change a full stop at the end of the sentence to a comma, no matter how hard we try but rather that we can always write a new line. I too have learned the same – to move forward and keep going , I have rediscovered aspects of my biggest passions; reading , music and foremost debating. I have found solace in my belief of living actively: rather than drifting through life like a cloud propelled by the wind, I do my best to be aware of the world around me- to be aware of the impact I have on the world and the impact that the world has on me. And so, as the USG of administration, I , Amritha Anil would like to welcome you to the DXBMUN’23 with the hopes that it will evoke beautiful lines in your story and propel you in your quest to live actively ~~</p>

Debating has been and is quite literally the best part of any conference for me in any competition, which is what initially drew me towards MUNs. However, aside from debating, I am often recognized as a swiftie and enjoy reading books and eating (other people's food) <3. I am super excited for DXBMUN23' and cannot wait to meet and work with new people! That's all from your USG of Admin and logistics... live laugh love food.</p>
